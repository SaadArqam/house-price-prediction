## 📌 Project Overview
- Built a regression model to predict house prices based on socio-economic and geographical features.
- Applied **feature scaling** using `StandardScaler` to ensure numerical stability and correct inference.
- Designed an **interactive UI** that allows users to input parameters and receive real-time predictions.
- Deployed the application as a publicly accessible web app using **Hugging Face Spaces**.
